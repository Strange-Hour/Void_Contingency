# Third-Party Directory

This directory contains external dependencies and libraries used by the project:

## Purpose

- Houses third-party libraries and frameworks
- Maintains specific versions of dependencies
- Keeps external code separate from project code

## Guidelines

- Each third-party library should be in its own subdirectory
- Include version information for each dependency
- Document any modifications to third-party code
- Keep license files for all third-party code
- Prefer package managers when possible, use this directory for:
  - Libraries not available through package managers
  - Libraries requiring specific versions or modifications
  - Git submodules for direct source integration
