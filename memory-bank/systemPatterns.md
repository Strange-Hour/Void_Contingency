# Void Contingency - System Patterns

## System Architecture

### Core Engine Structure

1. **Game Loop**

   - Fixed time step update
   - Event-driven architecture
   - State management system
   - Resource management

2. **Component System**

   - Entity-Component architecture
   - Modular system design
   - Event-based communication
   - Resource pooling

3. **Network Layer**
   - Client-server architecture
   - State synchronization
   - Input prediction
   - Lag compensation

### Key Technical Decisions

#### 1. Engine Design

- **Custom C++ Engine**

  - Chosen for performance and control
  - Allows for specific optimizations
  - Better memory management
  - Direct hardware access

- **2D Graphics System**
  - Sprite-based rendering
  - Layer management
  - Particle effects
  - Dynamic lighting

#### 2. Network Architecture

- **Authoritative Server**

  - Server maintains game state
  - Clients send inputs
  - State reconciliation
  - Anti-cheat measures

- **Network Protocol**
  - UDP for game state
  - TCP for critical events
  - Compression for efficiency
  - Delta encoding for updates

#### 3. Procedural Generation

- **Sector Generation**

  - Grid-based system
  - Node-based connections
  - Resource distribution
  - Encounter placement

- **Content Generation**
  - Template-based design
  - Parameterized variations
  - Seed-based reproducibility
  - Difficulty scaling

#### 4. Physics System

- **Collision Detection**

  - AABB-based broad phase
  - Precise collision shapes
  - Layer-based filtering
  - Performance optimization

- **Movement System**
  - Newtonian physics
  - Drag and inertia
  - Acceleration curves
  - Collision response

## Design Patterns in Use

### 1. Game Systems

- **Command Pattern**

  - Input handling
  - Network commands
  - Undo/redo support

- **Observer Pattern**

  - Event system
  - UI updates
  - State changes

- **State Pattern**
  - Game states
  - Player states
  - System states

### 2. Resource Management

- **Factory Pattern**

  - Entity creation
  - Resource loading
  - System initialization

- **Pool Pattern**
  - Memory management
  - Object reuse
  - Performance optimization

### 3. Network Communication

- **Proxy Pattern**

  - Network objects
  - State synchronization
  - Remote method calls

- **Mediator Pattern**
  - Message routing
  - Event distribution
  - System coordination
