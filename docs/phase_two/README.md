   - Ship rendering
   - Visual effects

6. **Collision System** (`ship_system/collision_system.md`)
   - Requires basic ship class and movement system
   - Collision detection
   - Collision response

### 2. Core Game Loop Implementation

After completing the ship system, implement the core game loop:

1. **Sector Generation** (`game_loop/sector_generation.md`)

   - Procedural sector creation
   - Environment generation
   - Resource placement

2. **Exploration Mechanics** (`game_loop/exploration.md`)

   - Requires sector generation
   - Discovery system
   - Navigation mechanics

3. **Resource Management** (`game_loop/resource_management.md`)

   - Resource tracking
   - Resource gathering
   - Resource utilization

4. **Combat Framework** (`game_loop/combat_framework.md`)

   - Requires ship system and resource management
   - Basic combat mechanics
   - Damage system

5. **Upgrade System** (`game_loop/upgrade_system.md`)
   - Requires ship system and resource management
   - Ship upgrades
   - Component modifications

## Getting Started

Each section contains detailed tutorials with:

- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Code examples
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Testing guidelines

Start with the Ship System Foundation section as it forms the basis for the other systems. Each tutorial builds upon the previous ones, so it's recommended to follow them in order.

## Prerequisites

Before starting Phase 2, ensure you have completed:

1. Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Architecture
2. Basic understanding of C++ and game development concepts
3. Familiarity with the project's build system and development environment
