# Void Contingency

A cooperative space survival game where you and your crew must navigate through the dangerous void, manage ship systems, and survive against all odds.

## Overview

Void Contingency is a top-down 2D space game that combines tactical combat, resource management, and crew coordination. Play solo or with up to 4 players as you explore procedurally generated sectors, upgrade your ship, and face increasingly dangerous challenges.

## Features

- **Cooperative Multiplayer**: Work together with up to 4 players
- **Unique Ship Classes**: Choose from various ship types with different capabilities
- **Dynamic Shield System**: Ship-specific shield configurations and upgrade paths
- **Crew Roles**: Captain, Engineering, Weapons, and Operations positions
- **Procedural Generation**: Explore unique sectors with different challenges
- **Resource Management**: Balance power, repairs, and combat resources
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Face increasingly dangerous encounters
