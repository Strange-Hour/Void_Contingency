# Void Contingency - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Void Contingency aims to fill a gap in the cooperative gaming space by providing a deep, tactical space survival experience that emphasizes teamwork and resource management. The game is designed to create meaningful player interactions through specialized roles and shared challenges.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Lack of Deep Cooperative Games**

   - Many cooperative games lack meaningful role specialization
   - Few games require true coordination between players
   - Limited options for complex system management in multiplayer

2. **Space Game Limitations**

   - Most space games focus on individual piloting
   - Few games explore the complexity of managing a full ship
   - Limited options for procedural space exploration with meaningful choices

3. **Resource Management Depth**
   - Many games simplify resource management
   - Few games require coordinated resource allocation
   - Limited options for meaningful upgrade paths

## How It Should Work

   - Resources are gathered and managed
   - Points of interest are discovered and investigated

2. **Combat Phase**

   - Crew coordinates to manage ship systems during combat
   - Different roles have specific combat responsibilities
